# Some-Basic-Noob-Apps-
The Apps  i made  during  pursuing  Rob Percival's training  at  Udemy .

git init
git add .
git commit -am "initial commit"
git remote add origin <your link>
git push -u origin master

git commands i used from your android studio console
i know about commit messages i was just checking out 
you can upload all in 5 minutes according to my experience
yeah but i used git push -f 
coz normally it was requiring a pull first so i put a -f in it
