# Some-Basic-Noob-Apps-
The Apps  i made  during  pursuing  Rob Percival's training  at  Udemy .

git init
git add .
git commit -am "initial commit"
git remote add origin <your link>
git push -u origin master

They are Working Codes  From  the old  Tutorial of Rob about Android 6   some  api apps might expire   
They currently  work  As of 25 july 2017  I have searched and changed alot of code for ease .
Each  directory has  Screenshot inside  it  .
